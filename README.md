ðŸš— Car Data Analysis & Cleaning Project


ðŸ“Œ Skills Demonstrated
âœ… Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values (NaN, ?), replacing with mean/mode.
âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Unit conversion (mpg â†’ L/100km), normalization, binning.
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ One-hot encoding (fuel-type, aspiration).
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Descriptive stats, histograms, bar plots.
âœ… Python Libraries Used â€“ Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Auto Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Features:

Numerical: price, horsepower, engine-size, mpg, etc.

Categorical: fuel-type, aspiration, num-of-doors, etc.


ðŸ”§ Data Processing Steps
Handled Missing Values

Replaced ? with NaN.

Dropped rows with missing price.

Filled missing numerical values (normalized-losses, bore, stroke) with mean.

Filled missing categorical values (num-of-doors) with mode.

Feature Engineering

Converted highway-mpg â†’ highway-L/100km for better interpretability.

Normalized length, width, height (min-max scaling).

Binned horsepower into categories (Low, Medium, High).

Categorical Data Encoding

One-hot encoded fuel-type (gas/diesel) and aspiration (std/turbo).

Exploratory Analysis

Descriptive statistics (df.describe()).

Visualizations:

Histogram of horsepower distribution.

Bar plot of horsepower bins.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
âœ” Most Common Car Specs:

Majority have four doors and gas fuel type.

Average horsepower: ~104 HP.

âœ” Missing Data Insights:

normalized-losses had X% missing values, filled with mean.

num-of-doors had missing entries, replaced with mode (four).

âœ” Feature Relationships:
