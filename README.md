# Car-pricing-data-analysis
This repository contains a Python-based project for analyzing used car pricing data. The code handles data cleaning (e.g., null/missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies) and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into factors influencing car prices, such as mileage, year, make/model, and more.
